Producing a new a Ciao version
------------------------------

Special Note: Since 25-11-2004, due to the use of the lpmake utility,
this document has changed.  In particular, have in mind that several
Makefile and SETTINGS files has been migrated to their equivalents in
lpdoc 2.0 and lpmake.


The general plan is usually: work on the current version until we
correct all problems we decided to solve, make test distributions and
try them, make a fresh copy of de development sources, increment the
version number, freeze it, post it on the web, and send a message to
ciao-users.

For producing a proper new version we should in addition at least
worry about the following:

  * That everything really works. This typically requires completely
    freezing the development version for some days in which we try
    everything that we can think of in all platforms.
    It is also necessary to try out all the examples in all the libraries.

  * That we have the even version (1.8, 2.0, 2.2, ...) comment in 
    /home/clip/Systems/ciao/doc/common/ciao.pl
    properly updated in a user-friendly manner, summing up all the changes.

  * That we do not distribute libraries that do not work.

  * That libraries which are half cooked are marked as such if they
    are included (e.g., the active module/remote stuff, the &-Prolog
    stuff, ...).

  * We need to have a new announcement message and a new brochure.


Continuous testing & updates
----------------------------

After you make any changes, especially the last ones, please check
thoroughly that nothing has stopped working.  Specifically,

    * Make sure the files you touched compile and that the documenter
      works on them.

    * Make sure that all Ciao compiles - look for warnings!

    * Make sure that you update all references to the predicates,
      etc. you've updated -- search through the entire Ciao
      Prolog source code tree ('M-x igrep' is a good way to do it).

    * Run the tests in the test directory (in 'local' mode).  While
      this does not go through all of Ciao capabilities it does try a
      bunch of things. Testing is currently made with:

      $ cd <ciao-this_version>/tests
      $ make distclean
      $ make test-local       (uses development version -- good for a
                               quick test when changing things)

    * Ideally one should add a test for every solved bug in order to
      make sure that it does not appear again.  Please do it if at all
      possible. 

      [N.B. I know that we have not really decided a policy to
      distribute examples/tests among a central directory and the
      library directories; however having a new bug catcher at least
      in one place, even if not the definitive one, is better than not
      having it at all.] 


We should also test bigger programs which we knew worked OK.  bibutils
and lpdoc are good candidates (because we use them often, and they are
not trivial).  However there is not means to execute them
automatically at the moment.


Solve the problems
------------------

Try to solve the glitches you find, but do not spend too much time on
them: send a brief report if you get stuck.  If you have found a new
bug, write down how to reproduce it along with the expected results in
$(CIAOSRC)/bugs/Pending.  There is even a file to write textual
descriptions (without code).  When fixed, move the bug description to
$(CIAOSRC)/bugs/Fixed.  $(CIAOSRC)/bugs/Unclassified contains bug
descriptions for which I (MCL) could not determine whether they have
been solved or not.  If you recognize any of them, please classify it.


Making a (Test) Distribution
----------------------------

After making sure that (most of) the pending bugs are solved, it is
time to make a test distribution and try it in several architectures.
_We should not post publicly any version without testing it_.  In order
to test a distribution, we typically post it in the alpha or beta
sites. The procedure of posting a version itself can be tested by
posting in Test. These WWW locations are at:

  http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Test/  
  http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Alpha/  
  http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/Beta/  

  (the Local user and password work)

To generate a distribution there, uncomment the appropriate option in
the DISTSETTINGS.pl file in the Ciao dist directory:

  % disttype:=''.
  % disttype:='Beta/'.
  % disttype:='Alpha/'.
  % disttype:='Test/'.

New test distributions are added generated with the command 

  $ lpmake installdistonly

in the 'dist' directory.

The main thing that we should make sure of when posting publicly
(outside Beta or Alpha) a version is that it installs properly in all
platforms, including the manuals, etc.. Also, we should make sure that
there is no weird stuff (libraries that normally work but that have
been left in an intermediary state and don't work, files with comments
in Spanish, directories with libraries that don't work at all, etc.,
etc.).  Again, this needs both visual inspection _and_ running tests,
both automatic and manual. Even when we post the first public version,
it should be clear that it may have unsolved and unexpected bugs, and
hope that a few brave souls will find them and that we should correct
them.


What goes in a distribution
---------------------------

Not everything in the Ciao sources go into the distributions:
directories with the file NODISTRIBUTE do not make it into the
distribution; directories named .bak or .new or .old (and files also)
are automatically removed.  However, making sure that the whole
development system compiles correctly will help us to have a cleaner
system to continue with, and have more chances that the distribution
also compiles and runs correctly.  Please delete outdated and
intermediate files, and store backup files (which may contain
interesting ideas) in separate directories.  Document the existence of
these files and ideas (a comment in the code of the 'live' modules is
probably appropriate).


Changelog
---------

The world receives the announcement of a new version of software with
a highlight of its new/improved features.  In our case, this means
going through /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/version/ChangeLog (C-c
C-n does that) and grouping all the changes in a way similar to what
appears in /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/doc/common/ciao.pl for
versions 1.8 and 1.6.  A similar changelog file will go into the
brochure for the new version (see, e.g.,
/home/clip/Systems/ciao-1.9/doc/brochure).


Documentation
-------------

The documentation should be as complete and correct as possible.
Please check that every change you do can be documented (introducing
syntactic errors is easy).  In order to generate the documentation:

    1. Go to /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/doc , do 'lpmake
    realclean' and 'lpmake'.  Make sure that there are no
    errors/warnings, and correct them if they appear.

    2. Verify that the documentation has been generated correctly.  It
    should appear under /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/doc/reference in
    .info, .pdf, and HTML formats.  Have a look at it, verify that the
    links (in info and HTML formats) are not dead.  Check that your
    environment variables are right.  In particular, when generating
    pdf files, is very important to set: 
      
    GS_OPTIONS=-sPAPERSIZE=a4

    This let us to use the righ options with GS.
 
    3. Check that every library in the distribution has a well-formed
    manual page. This means that every module in the distribution
    should appear explicitly in the documentation paths. Directories
    to look for are stated in the variable SYSTEMPATHS in file
    /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/doc/common/LPDOCCOMMON.pl , and
    the particular modules to document make up the variable
    component/1 in
    /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/doc/reference/LPSETTINGS.pl. This
    variable is split in several pieces. Add the necessary _file_
    names there to component/1 and directory names to systempath/1. A
    component should appear here iff it goes into the distribution;
    otherwise the documentation will be out of sync with respect to
    the distribution. If a component has several modules, usually only
    those intended for the user should appear in the documentation.

We only need to make sure that the documentation is generated
correctly in Linux, as it is produced in several formats and it is
distributed ready to consult.  


Compiling and installing a distribution
---------------------------------------

Download a distribution for the architecture you are testing, and
compile it if needed (I will assume that this is the case).
Distributions should be installed and tested in clean environments.
Ideally, this means using a machine with no Ciao installed.
Otherwise, you should clear your environment variables of any trace of
paths and environment variables pointing to Ciao stuff.  'which ciao'
will point to executables -- remove from PATH the corresponding paths.
Any environment variable starting by CIAO ('env | grep CIAO') should
also be removed prior to compilation.

We _must_ compile and test in all supported architectures (at least:
LINUX i86, LINUX Sparc, Solaris Sparc, Solaris i86, Windows i86,
Darwin PPC).

Perform the installation _exactly_ as it is stated in the INSTALLATION
file.  Adapt the variables in SETTINGS to some sensible directory (can
even be something as /tmp/my_ciao).  Compile and install under a user
and test with another user, in order to make sure that everything gets
compiled and needed.  You can make the installation as root and the
testing as yourself.  Make sure every step of the installation works.


Testing the installation
------------------------

Testing is partially done while compiling; in order to test that
things work in architectures other than the one we are developing in,
one can retrieve the tests directory (see above) and use it in the
distribution directories.  This minimal testing must be done for every
architecture.

The installed version ought to behave as the development one.  We have
to check that the necessary files are reachable / in place, possibly
after adjusting shell paths (read: change .cshrc/.bashrc) to point to
our installation.

General tests
-------------

Should be done for every UN*X target architecture

    * ciao, ciaosh, ciaoc must be reachable and they must belong to
      the distribution we have installed.

    * The initialization files (DOTprofile / DOTcshrc) must be in
      place (these are consulted from the shell initialization files).

    * Emacs Info / WWW / .pdf / man files must also be in place.  Open
      them with a WWW browser.  Make 'info ciao' to verify that the
      environment variables point to the right place.

    * 'man ciao' should bring up the manual page.

    * Compile and run the tests, and check that everything works.


Emacs mode tests
----------------

    * Verify (C-h i) that the Ciao info files _for the version you
      installed_ are visible.

    * Load /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/examples/hw.pl , check
      that buffer coloring works (substitute the Ciao path by the
      directory where the sources you dowloaded are).

    * Check that the Ciao menu options appear on top of Emacs window. In
      Linux Emacsen, check that button bar also appears.

    * C-c l to load the file into Ciao top-level and call main/1
      to check basic top-level functionality.

    * Put the cursor over write/1 and hit C-c tab to go to the Ciao
      documentation (in info format). 

    * Load hw.pl in debug mode (C-c d), run main/1, go through the
      execution until its end.

    * Move the cursor to last line of main/0, and do C-c S b to
      check breakpoints. Run main/2 again, and press 'l' to check that
      the execution stops at the correct program point. 


Windows-specific tests
----------------------

    * From the file explorer of Windows: check right-button menus
      - Load hw.pl into the shell.
      - Make an executable from it (must generate hw.bat and hw.cpx
        files).  These should start up when double-clicking on it.
      - Generate also an executable from 

        /home/clip/Systems/ciao-<version>/examples/misc/suite.pl

        and run it.

    * 'cd' to 'tests/WindowsSpecific' directory, and run windows.pl,
      to check path management in windows. 

    * If you want to mount the //clip/clip shared folder in windows,
      remember that is necessary to enable windows to transmit plain
      text passwords, just following the next steps:

      Windows XP:

      Go to Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Local
      Security Policy > Local Policies > Security Options and enable
      Microsoft Network Client: Send unencrypted password to
      third-party SMB servers.

      Windows 98:

      Start regedit.exe, and add the following key with a DWORD value
      of 1: My Computer\ HKEY Local Machine\ System\
      CurrentControlSet\ Services\ VxD\ VNETSUP\
      EnablePlainTextPassword (elimanate the extra spaces; they're
      just for line wrapping)

Document and propagate the changes
----------------------------------

All updates should be integrated into the main Ciao repository, with
the appropriate comment. Please do not forget to do that.  Also, if we
are patching a version which is not the latest one, propagate the
changes and their documentation to the more modern one.


Short instructions to make a new distribution
---------------------------------------------

    * Check that your environment variables are right.  In particular,
      When generating pdf files, is very important to set:
      
      GS_OPTIONS=-sPAPERSIZE=a4

      This let us to use the righ options with GS.

    * Go to a Linux box, clean everything ('make distclean') [that
      could be skipped if we were completely sure that all .po are OK,
      but since we have been having problems lately, it seems better
      to start from scratch; these .po go into the Windows
      distribution].

    * Recompile the distribution in Linux: 'make'

    * Recompile engine in Windows: 'make engine'.

    * Go to the 'dist' directory, make sure disttype is set to, e.g.,
      "Test" (this selects which subdirectory the distribution will be
      left in --- it is VERY important to set it to Test, or some
      other subdirectory, before making a final distribution), make
      sure GEN_WIN32PREC is set to 'yes'.

    * Type 'make install'.  Make sure the documentation and the tar
      and zip files are being built correctly.

    * Download the just made distribution, test it (compile _at least_
      in a Linux box, run some examples, download an install in a
      clean [no Ciao] Windows machine, run some examples).  If
      everything goes OK, proceed.  Otherwise, try to correct the
      errors, notify about them, step back and repeat.

    * If everything went smooth: go to the 'dist' directory, make sure
      disttype is set to nothing ('disttype='), type:

        - 'make installdistonly' if the distribution is a snapshot,
          i.e., not a new main distribution, with some bugs corrected,
          etc.

        - 'make install' if we are releasing a new distribution with a
          lot of new features, etc.


Special notes when testing / installing new versions for ASAP project
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In adition to the test above, is necessary to do the folowwing:

1- uninstall ciao in the asapdemo account
2- install the new ciao version
3- uninstall lpdoc in the asapdemo account
4- install the new lpdoc version
5- remove the old sources for ciao and lpdoc
6- test that ciaopp lpmake works fine in asapdemo
7- uninstall ciao in /usr/local
8- remove ciao from /usr/local/src
9- install ciao in /usr/local
10- check that the crontab entries for ciao/ciaopp compilation works
    well.
