The Ciao/Prolog @concept{emacs interface} (or @em{mode} @cindex{emacs mode}
in @apl{emacs} terms) provides a rich, integrated user interface to the
Ciao @index{program development environment} components, including the
@apl{ciaosh} interactive top level and the @apl{ciaopp} preprocessor. While
most features of the Ciao development environment are available from the
command line of the preprocessor and the top-level shell, using Ciao inside
@apl{emacs} is highly recommended. The facilities that this mode provides
include:

@begin{itemize}

@item @index{Syntax-based highlighting} (coloring), @cindex{coloring,
syntax} @index{auto-indentation}, @index{auto-fill}, etc. of code. This
includes the assertions used by the preprocessor and the documentation
strings used by the Ciao auto-documenter, @apl{lpdoc}.

@item Providing automatic access to @concept{on-line help} for all
predicates by accessing the Ciao system manuals in @apl{info} format.

@item Starting and communicating with @apl{ciaopp}, the @index{Ciao
preprocessor}, running in its own @concept{sub-shell}. This allows easily
performing certain kinds of @index{static checks} (useful for finding
errors in programs before running them), program analysis tasks, and
@index{program transformations} on source programs.

@item Starting and communicating with the @index{Ciao top-level}, running
in its own @concept{sub-shell}. This facilitates loading programs, checking
the @em{syntax} of programs (and of @index{assertions} within programs),
marking and unmarking modules for interactive debugging, @index{tracing the
source code} @cindex{source-level debugging} @cindex{debugging,
source-level} during debugging, making stand-alone executables, compiling
modules to dynamically linkable Prolog objects, compiling modules to active
objects, etc.

@item Syntax highlighting and coloring of the error and warning messages
produced by the top level, preprocessor, or any other tool using the same
message format (such as the @apl{lpdoc} auto-documenter), and @em{locating
automatically the points in the source files where such errors occur}.

@item Performing automatic @index{version control} and keeping a
@index{changelog} of individual files or whole applications. This is done
by automatically including changelog entries in source files, which can
then be processed by the @apl{lpdoc} auto-documenter.

@end{itemize}

This chapter explains how to use the Ciao/Prolog @apl{emacs} interface and
how to set up your @apl{emacs} environment for correct operation.  The Ciao
@apl{emacs} interface can also be used to work with other Prolog or CLP
systems.

@section{Conventions for writing Ciao programs under Emacs}
@cindex{formatting conventions, for emacs} 

This is particularly important for the @concept{source-level debugger}
and the @concept{syntax-based coloring} capabilities.  This is due to
the fact that it would be unrealistic to write a complete Prolog
parser in Emacs lisp. These conventions are the following, in order of
importance:

@begin{itemize}

@item Clauses should begin on the first column (this is used to recognize
      the beginning of a clause). 

@item C style comments should not be used in a clause, but can be used
      outside any clause.

@end{itemize}

@noindent 
The following suggestion is not strictly necessary but can improve
operation:

@begin{itemize}

@item Body literals should be indented. There should be not more than
one literal per line. This allows more precision in the location of
program points during source-level debugging, i.e., when marking
breakpoints and during line tracing.

@end{itemize}

@noindent Comments which start with @tt{%}s are indented to the right
if indentation is asked for.

@noindent For syntax-based highlighting to be performed font-lock must
be available and not disabled (the Ciao mode enables it but it may be
disabled elsewhere in, e.g., the @file{.emacs} file).

@section{Checking the installation}

Typically, a complete pre-installation of the Ciao/Prolog @apl{emacs}
interface is completed during Ciao installation. To check that
installation was done and sucessful, open a file with a @tt{.pl}
ending. You should see that @apl{emacs} enters Ciao/Prolog mode: the
mode is identified in the @concept{status bar} below the
@concept{buffer} and, if the @concept{emacs menu bar} is enabled, you
should see the Ciao/Prolog menus. You should be able from the
menu-bar, for example, to go to the Ciao manuals in the info or load
the @tt{.pl} file that you just opened into a ciao top level.

If things don't work properly, see the section @ref{Installation of the
Ciao/Prolog emacs interface} later in this chapter.

@section{Functionality and associated key sequences (bindings)}

The following sections summarize the capabilities of the Ciao/Prolog
emacs interface and the (default) @index{key sequences} used to access
those capabilities.  Most of these functions are accessible also from
the menu bar.

  ;; This inserts the documentation strings for the bindings.
  (ciao-do-document-bindings (nreverse ciao-documented-commands))

  (insert-string (concat "

@section{Using Ciao/Prolog mode capabilities in standard shells} 

The capabilities (commands, coloring, error location, ...) which are
active in the Ciao/Prolog @em{inferior} mode can also be made
available in any standard command line shell which is being run within
emacs. This can be enabled by going to the buffer in which the shell
is running and typing ``@key{M-x} @tt{ciao-inferior-mode}''.  This is
very useful for example when running the stand-alone compiler, the
@apl{lpdoc} auto-documenter, or even certain user applications (those
that use the standard error message library) in an emacs
sub-shell. Turning the Ciao/Prolog inferior mode on on that sub-shell
will highlight and color the error messages, and automatically find
and visit the locations in the files in which the errors are reported.

Finally, one the most useful applications of this is when using the
@concept{embedded debugger} (a version of the debugger which can be
embedded into executables so that an interactive debugging session can
be triggered at any time while running that executable without needing
the top-level shell). If an application is run in a shell buffer which
has been set with Ciao inferior mode (@key{M-x} @tt{ciao-inferior-mode}) and
this application starts emitting output from the embedded debugger
(i.e., which contains the embedded debugger and is debugging its code)
then the Ciao emacs mode will be able to follow these messages, for
example tracking execution in the source level code. This also works
if the application is written in a combination of languages, provided
the parts written in Ciao are compiled with the embedded debugger
package and is thus a covenient way of debugging multi-language
applications. The only thing needed is to make sure that the output
messages appear in a shell buffer that is in Ciao inferior mode.



@section{Customization}

This section explains all variables used in the Ciao/Prolog emacs mode
which can be customized by users. Such customization can be performed
(in later versions of @apl{emacs}) from the @apl{emacs} menus
(@tt{Help -> Customize -> Top-level Customization Group}), or also by
adding a @tt{setq} expression in the @tt{.emacs} file. Such @tt{setq}
expression should be similar to:

@tt{(setq <variable> <new_value>)}

@noindent The following sections list the different variables which can be
customized for @apl{ciao}, @apl{ciaopp} and @apl{lpdoc}.\n"))

(ciao-document-variables)

(insert-string (concat "

@section{Installation of the Ciao/Prolog emacs interface}

If opening a file ending with @tt{.pl} puts emacs in another mode
(such as @apl{perl} mode, which is the --arguably incorrect-- default
setting in some @apl{emacs} distributions), then either the emacs mode
was not installed or the installation settings are being overwritten
by other settings in your @tt{.emacs} file or in some library.  In any
case, you can set things manually so that the Ciao/Prolog mode is
loaded by default in your system. This can be done by including in
your @file{.emacs} file a line such as:

@tt{(load ""<CIAOLIBDIR>/ciao-mode-init"")}

@noindent This loads the above mentioned file from the Ciao library, which
contains the following lines (except that the paths are changed during
installation to appropriate values for your system):

@begin{verbatim}
@includeverbatim{ciao-mode-init.el.skel}
@end{verbatim}

If you would like to configure things in a different way, you can also
copy the contents of this file to your @file{.emacs} file and make the
appropriate changes.  For example, if you do not want @tt{.pl} files
to be put automatically in Ciao/Prolog mode, then comment out (or
remove) the line:

@tt{(setq auto-mode-alist} ... @tt{)}

@noindent You will then need to switch manually to Ciao/Prolog mode by
typing @tt{M-x ciao-mode} after opening a Prolog file.

If you are able to open the Ciao/Prolog menu but the Ciao manuals are not
found or the @apl{ciao} command (the top-level) is not found when loading
@tt{.pl} files, the probable cause is that you do not have the Ciao paths
in the @tt{INFOPATH} and @tt{MANPATH} @index{environment variables}
(whether these variables are set automatically or not for users depends on
how the Ciao system was installed). Under Un*x, you can add these paths
easily by including the line:

@tt{source <CIAOLIBDIR>/DOTcshrc}

@noindent in your @tt{.login} or @tt{.cshrc} files if you are using
@apl{csh} (or @apl{tcsh}, etc.), or, alternatively, the line:

@tt{. <CIAOLIBDIR>/DOTprofile}

@noindent in your @tt{.login} or @tt{.profile} files if you are using
@apl{sh} (or @apl{bash}, etc.). See the Ciao installation instructions
(@ref{Installing Ciao from the source distribution} or @ref{Installing
Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution}) for details.

present, then @apl{lpdoc} will be able to automatically assign up to
date version numbers to the manuals that it generates. This way it is
always possible to identify to which version of the software a manual
corresponds. Also, @apl{lpdoc} can create automatically sections
describing the changes made since previous versions, which are
extracted from the comments in the changelog entries.

The main effect of these commands is to automatically associate the
following information to a set of changes performed in the file and/or
in a set of related files:

@begin{itemize}

@item a @index{version number} (such as, e.g., @tt{1.2}, where @tt{1}
is the @concept{major version number} and @tt{2} is the @concept{minor
version number}),

@item a @concept{patch number} (such as, e.g., the @tt{4} in
@tt{1.2#4}), 

@item a @concept{time stamp} (such as, e.g.,
@tt{1998/12/14,17:20*28+MET}),

@item the author of the change, @cindex{change, author} and

@item a comment explaining the change. @cindex{change, comment}
@end{itemize}

The @concept{version numbering} used can be local to a single file or
common to a number of related files. A simple version numbering policy
is implemented: when a relevant change is made, the user typically
inserts a @concept{changelog entry} for it, using the appropriate
command (or selecting the corresponding option when prompted while
saving a file). This will cause the @em{patch number} for the file (or
for the whole system that the file is part of) to be incremented
automatically and the corresponding machine-readable comment to be
inserted in the file. Major and minor version numbers can also be
changed, but this is always invoked by hand (see below).

The changelog entry is written in the form of a @decl{comment/2}
declaration.  As mentioned before, the advantage of using this kind of
changelog entries is that these declarations can be processed by the
@apl{lpdoc} automatic documenter (see the @apl{lpdoc} reference
manual @cite{lpdoc-tr} or the @lib{assertions} library documentation
for more details on these declarations). 

Whether the user is asked or not to introduce such changelog entries,
and how the patch and version numbers should be increased is
controlled by the presence in the file of a @pred{comment/2}
declaration of the type:

@tt{:- comment(version_maintenance,<type>).}

@noindent (note that this requires including the @lib{assertions}
library in the source file).  These declarations themselves are also
typically introduced automatically when using this mode (see below).

The version maintenance mode can also be set alternatively by
inserting a comment such as:

@begin{verbatim}
%% Local Variables: 
%% mode: ciao
%% update-version-comments: \"off\"
%% End:
@end{verbatim}

The lines above instruct emacs to put the buffer visiting the file in
@concept{emacs Ciao/Prolog mode} and to turn version maintenance off.
Setting the version maintenance mode in this way has the disadvantage
that @apl{lpdoc}, the auto-documenter, and other related tools will
not be aware of the type of version maintenance being performed (the
lines above are comments for Prolog). However, this can be useful in
fact for setting the @index{version maintenance mode for packages} and
other files meant for inclusion in other files, since that way the
settings will not affect the file in which the package is included.

The following commands implement the version control support:

also allow changing the arguments that these executables take, and changing
the path where the libraries reside. In the case of the top-level and
preprocessor, this should be done only by users which understand the
implications, but it is very useful if several versions of Ciao/Prolog or

   "As mentioned previously, the Ciao/Prolog @apl{emacs} interface can
also be used to work with other Prolog or CLP systems. Also, the
Ciao/Prolog @apl{emacs} interface (@em{mode}) can coexist with other
Prolog-related @apl{emacs} interfaces (@em{modes}) @cindex{emacs mode,
loading several} (such as, e.g., the @apl{SICStus} Prolog
interface). Only one of the interfaces can be active at a time for a
given buffer (i.e., for each given file opened inside @apl{emacs}). In
order the change a buffer to a given interface, move the cursor to
that buffer and type @tt{M-x ...-mode} (e.g., for the Ciao/Prolog
mode, @tt{M-x ciao-mode}).

If several Prolog-related @apl{emacs} interfaces are loaded, then
typically the @em{last} one to be loaded takes precedence, in the
sense that this will be the interface in which @apl{emacs} will be set
when opening files which have a @tt{.pl} ending (this depends a bit on
how things are set up in your @tt{.emacs} file).")

  "This is the standard @apl{emacs} command that saves a buffer by
writing the contents into the associated @tt{.pl} file.  However, in
Ciao/Prolog mode this command can be set to ask the user before saving
whether to introduce a changelog entry documenting the changes performed.

If the buffer does not already contain a comment specifying the
@concept{type of version control} to be performed, and before saving
the buffer, the Ciao/Prolog mode prompts the user to choose among the
following options:

   @begin{description} 

   @item{@key{q}} Turn off prompting for the introduction of changelog
entries for now. @apl{emacs} will not ask again while the buffer is
loaded, but it will ask again next time you load the buffer.

   @item{@key{n}} Turn off version control for this file. A version
control comment such as:

@tt{:- comment(version_maintenance,off).}

@noindent is added to the buffer and the file is saved. @apl{emacs}
will not perform any version control on this file until the line above
is removed or modified (i.e., from now on \\<ciao-mode-map>
\\[ciao-save-buffer] simply saves the buffer).

   @item{@key{y}} Turn version control on for this file. 

   @end{description}

   If @key{y} is selected, then the system prompts again regarding how
and where the version and patch number information is to be
maintained. The following options are available:

   @begin{description}

   @item{@tt{on}} All version control information will be contained
within this file. When saving a buffer \\<ciao-mode-map>
(\\[ciao-save-buffer]) emacs will ask if a changelog entry should be
added to the file before saving. If a comment is entered by the user,
a new patch number is assigned to it and the comment is added to the
file. This patch number will be the one that follows the most recent
changelog entry already in the file. This is obviously useful when
maintaining version numbers individually for each file.

   @item{@tt{<directory_name>}} Global version control will be
performed coherently on several files. When saving a buffer
\\<ciao-mode-map> (\\[ciao-save-buffer]) emacs will ask if a changelog
entry should be added to the file before saving. If a comment is
given, the global patch number (which will be kept in the file:
@tt{<directory_name>/GlobalPatch}) is atomically incremented and the
changelog entry is added to the current file, associated to that patch
number. Also, a small entry is added to a file
@tt{<directory_name>/GlobalChangeLog} which points to the current
file. This allows inspecting all changes sequentially by visiting all
the files where the changes were made (see \\<ciao-mode-map> 
\\[ciao-fetch-next-changelog-entry]). This is obviously useful when
maintaining a single thread of version and patch numbers for a set of
files.

   @item{@tt{off}} Turns off version control: \\[ciao-save-buffer] then simply
   saves the file as usual. 

   @end{description}

@bf{Some useful tips:} 

@begin{itemize}

@item If a changelog entry is in fact introduced, the cursor is left
at the point in the file where the comment was inserted and the mark
is left at the original file point. This allows inspecting (and
possibly modifying) the changelog entry, and then returning to the
original point in the file by simply typing
\\[exchange-point-and-mark].

@item @cindex{moving changelog entries} The first changelog entry is
entered by default at the end of the buffer. Later, the changelog
entries can be moved anywhere else in the file. New changelog entries
are always inserted just above the first changelog entry which appears
in the file.

@item The comments in changelog entries can be edited at any time. 

@item If a changelog entry is moved to another file, and version
numbers are shared by several files through a directory, the
corresponding file pointer in the
@tt{<directory_name>/GlobalChangeLog} file needs to be changed also,
for the entry to be locatable later using
\\[ciao-fetch-next-changelog-entry].

This is a major emacs mode used in Ciao-related interactive buffers,
i.e., buffers in which it is possible to interact with an inferior
process running the Ciao/Prolog top-level, Ciao preprocessor,
documenter, etc.

You can talk to the Ciao/Prolog top-level or the preprocessor by
typing commands directly in the corresponding buffer as if in a normal
shell. You can also send files or parts of files to be preprocessed or
compiled by the processes running under this inferior mode from any
buffer which is in ciao-mode (see the emacs commands available in such
buffers).

All commands available in standard emacs shell packages (comint) are
available in these interactive buffers. In addition, there are many
new commands which are specific to this mode.  The following is a list
of all the available commands:

\\{ciao-inferior-mode-map}

Entry to this mode calls the value of ciao-mode-hook with no arguments,
qif that value is non-nil.  Likewise with the value of comint-mode-hook.
ciao-mode-hook is called after comint-mode-hook.
